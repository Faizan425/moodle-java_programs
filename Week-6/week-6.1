Problem Statement:
Given a String input1, which contains many number of words separated by : and each word contains exactly two lower case alphabets, generate an output based upon the below 2 cases.

Note:

1.      All the characters in input 1 are lowercase alphabets.

2.      input 1 will always contain more than one word separated by :

3.      Output should be returned in uppercase.

Case 1:

Check whether the two alphabets are same.

If yes, then take one alphabet from it and add it to the output.

Example 1:

input1 = ww:ii:pp:rr:oo

output = WIPRO

Explanation:

word1 is ww, both are same hence take w

word2 is ii, both are same hence take i

word3 is pp, both are same hence take p

word4 is rr, both are same hence take r

word5 is oo, both are same hence take o

Hence the output is WIPRO

Case 2:

If the two alphabets are not same, then find the position value of them and find maximum value – minimum value.

Take the alphabet which comes at this (maximum value - minimum value) position in the alphabet series.

Example 2”

input1 = zx:za:ee

output = BYE

Explanation

word1 is zx, both are not same alphabets

position value of z is 26

position value of x is 24

max – min will be 26 – 24 = 2

Alphabet which comes in 2nd position is b

Word2 is za, both are not same alphabets

position value of z is 26

position value of a is 1

max – min will be 26 – 1 = 25

Alphabet which comes in 25th position is y

word3 is ee, both are same hence take e

Hence the output is BYE



Code:

import java.util.*;
public class StringProcessor{
    public static  String processString(String input1){
        String [] words = input1.split(":");
        StringBuilder output=new StringBuilder();
        for(String word: words){
            char char1=word.charAt(0);
            char char2=word.charAt(1);
        
        if(char1==char2){
            output.append(Character.toUpperCase(char1));
        }
        else{
            int pos1=char1-'a'+1;
            int pos2=char2-'a'+1;
            int difference = Math.abs(pos1-pos2);
            char resultChar=(char)('a'+difference-1);
            output.append(Character.toUpperCase(resultChar));
        }
    }
    return output.toString();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        String input=sc.nextLine();
        String processedInput=input.split("//")[0].replaceAll("\\s+","");
        String result = processString(processedInput);
        System.out.println(result);
        sc.close();
    }
    
}
