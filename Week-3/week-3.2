Problem Statement:

You are provided with a set of numbers (array of numbers).

You have to generate the sum of specific numbers based on its position in the array set provided to you.

This is explained below:

Example 1:

Let us assume the encoded set of numbers given to you is:

input1:5 and input2: {1, 51, 436, 7860, 41236}

Step 1:

Starting from the 0th index of the array pick up digits as per below:

0th index – pick up the units value of the number (in this case is 1).

1st index - pick up the tens value of the number (in this case it is 5).

2nd index - pick up the hundreds value of the number (in this case it is 4).

3rd index - pick up the thousands value of the number (in this case it is 7).

4th index - pick up the ten thousands value of the number (in this case it is 4).

(Continue this for all the elements of the input array).

The array generated from Step 1 will then be – {1, 5, 4, 7, 4}.

Step 2:

Square each number present in the array generated in Step 1.

{1, 25, 16, 49, 16}

Step 3:

Calculate the sum of all elements of the array generated in Step 2 to get the final result. The result will be = 107.

Note:

1)     While picking up a number in Step1, if you observe that the number is smaller than the required position then use 0.

2)     In the given function, input1[] is the array of numbers and input2 represents the number of elements in input1.

Example 2:

input1: 5 and input1: {1, 5, 423, 310, 61540}

Step 1:

Generating the new array based on position, we get the below array:

{1, 0, 4, 0, 6}

In this case, the value in input1 at index 1 and 3 is less than the value required to be picked up based on position, so we use a 0.

Step 2:

{1, 0, 16, 0, 36}

Step 3:

The final result = 53.

Code:

import java.util.*;
public class prog{
    public  static int extractDigit(int num,int position){
        String numstr=String.valueOf(num);
        int length = numstr.length();
        if(position>=length){
            return 0;
        }
        char digit=numstr.charAt(length-1-position);
        return Character.getNumericValue(digit);
    }
    public static void main(String [] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n= sc.nextInt();
        int [] arr=new int[n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
        }
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            arr[i]=extractDigit(arr[i],i);
        }
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            arr[i]=arr[i]*arr[i];
        }
        int sum=0;
        for(int i:arr){
            sum+=i;
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
