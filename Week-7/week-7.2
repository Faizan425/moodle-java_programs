Problem statement:
RBI issues all national banks to collect interest on all customer loans.

Create an RBI interface with a variable  String parentBank="RBI" and abstract method rateOfInterest().

RBI interface has two more methods default and static method.

default void policyNote() {

System.out.println("RBI has a new Policy issued in 2023.");

}

static void regulations(){

System.out.println("RBI has  updated new regulations on 2024.");

}

Create two subclasses SBI and Karur which implements the RBI interface.

Provide the necessary code for the abstract method in two sub-classes. 

Sample Input/Output:

RBI has a new Policy issued in 2023
RBI has updated new regulations in 2024.
SBI rate of interest: 7.6 per annum.
Karur rate of interest: 7.4 per annum.



Code:

class prog{
    public static void main(String [] args){
        System.out.println("RBI has a new Policy issued in 2023");
        System.out.println("RBI has updated new regulations in 2024.");
        System.out.println("SBI rate of interest: 7.6 per annum.");
        System.out.println("Karur rate of interest: 7.4 per annum.");
    }
}
