problem statement:
You and your friend are movie fans and want to predict if the movie is going to be a hit!

The movie’s success formula depends on 2 parameters:

the acting power of the actor (range 0 to 10)

the critic’s rating of the movie (range 0 to 10)

The movie is a hit if the acting power is excellent (more than 8) or the rating is excellent (more than 8). This holds true except if either the acting power is poor (less than 2) or rating is poor (less than 2), then the movie is a flop. Otherwise the movie is average.

Write a program that takes 2 integers:

the first integer is the acting power

second integer is the critic’s rating.

You have to print Yes if the movie is a hit, Maybe if the movie is average and No if the movie is flop.

Example input:

9 5

Output:

Yes

Example input:

1 9

Output:

No

Example input:

6 4

Output:

Maybe



code:


import java.util.*;
class prog{
    public static void main(String [] args){
        Scanner sc= new Scanner (System.in);
        int ap=sc.nextInt();
        int cr=sc.nextInt();
        if(ap<2 || cr<2){
            System.out.println("No");
        }
        else if(ap>8 || cr>8){
            System.out.println("Yes");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("Maybe");
        }
    }
}
