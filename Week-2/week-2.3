Problem Statement:
You have recently seen a motivational sports movie and want to start exercising regularly. Your coach tells you that it is important to get up early in the morning to exercise. She sets up a schedule for you:

On weekdays (Monday - Friday), you have to get up at 5:00. On weekends (Saturday & Sunday), you can wake up at 6:00. However, if you are on vacation, then you can get up at 7:00 on weekdays and 9:00 on weekends.

Write a program to print the time you should get up.

The integer tells you the day it is (1-Sunday, 2-Monday, 3-Tuesday, 4-Wednesday, 5-Thursday, 6-Friday, 7-Saturday). The boolean is true if you are on vacation and false if youâ€™re not on vacation.

You have to print the time you should get up.

Code:

import java.util.*;
class prog{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        boolean b;
        int d;
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        d=sc.nextInt();
        b=sc.nextBoolean();
        if((d>=2 && d<=6)&& b==false){
            System.out.println("5:00");
        }
        else if((d>=2 && d<=6) && b){
            System.out.println("7:00");
        }
        else if((d==1||d==7)&&b==false){
            System.out.println("6:00");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("9:00");
        }
    }
}
